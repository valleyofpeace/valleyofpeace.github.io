This website has been created to provide information regarding the *Wadi al-Salaam* (Valley of Peace) and *Ahl-al-Bayt* graveyard sections located at the Arlington/Elm Lawn  Cemetery, in the metropolitan Chicago area. 
We shall also try to maintain a current list of all graves, including gravesite pictures online so that people can offer *Surah-e-Fateha* to their loved ones who have passed on. 
The function of the website also includes information about Funeral Services, Contact details, Funeral Rites & Laws, Supplications, and brief History about other famous Islamic Cemeteries around the world. 
We hope you will help us by sending us your suggestions and visits to our website. 
For any type of questions, suggestions, or general queries feel free to contact us.
