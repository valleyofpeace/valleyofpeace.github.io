We shall also try to maintain a current list of all graves, including gravesite pictures online so that people can offer *Surah-e-Fateha* to their loved ones who have passed on. 
The function of the website also includes information about Funeral Services, Contact details, Funeral Rites & Laws, Supplications, and brief History about other famous Islamic Cemeteries around the world. 
We hope you will help us by sending us your suggestions and visits to our website.
